# CMSC412-Vampire-Numbers
The second project of CMSC412 requires one to find all of the vampire numbers
from 100,000 to 999,999 using multiple threads. One must also join the main
thread to the 2 worker threads (wait on them to finish) and print the total 
number of vampire numbers as well as the specific number found by each worker.
